      If it exists, click “Claim” which will send us your request and we’ll
      grant approval for you to take ownership of the page.

      If it says “Requested” beside your company’s name, that means someone
      else has claimed your profile. If you feel this has been done in error,
      please email ciaran@startupdublin.com outlining the issue.
